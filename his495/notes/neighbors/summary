In Gross's account in Neighbors, pogrom began on the morning of July 10, 1941, when Jedwabne's town council met with the Gestapo.  

Shortly thereafter, the town's mayor ordered Jedwabne's gendarmerie to organize the non-Jewish population of the town for the collection of nearby Jews into the town square. 

After being gathered into the town square, the pogrom proceeded with cruelty. One group of Jews was ordered to dismantle a statue of Vladamir Lenin and carry it out of town while singing Soviet anthems. 

This group of Jews, including the local Rabbi, were lead into a barn and killed. Later that day, the remaining Jewish population of Jedwabne was gathered into the barn and immolated.
