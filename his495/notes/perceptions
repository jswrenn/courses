Reactions to the massacre in Poland were fiercly divided across class lines.

In April 2001:

Regardless of historical merit of Gross's work, Neighbors, unlike all previous treatments of the Jedwabne massacre, succeeded in penetrated broader public consciousness. Surveys conducted in April 2001 revealed that 90% of Poles were aware of the Jedwabne massacre--by August 2001, 97% of Poles had heard of the crime. Gross's thesis, however, had not been altogether convincing. Only 11% of respondents believed Poles were primarily culpable for the crime, and only a slightly greater fraction, 19% believed that Poles shared the burdon guilt with the occupying Germans. 

Who the respondents believed the perpetrators were, however, was strongly correllated with their educational and socio-vocational background. Those in cities were more than twice as likely to cite the participation of Poles as were those living in rural areas. Among respondents with a primary, vocational, high school, and higher education, the percentage of those who expressed a belief that Poles were, at least, partially culpable of the massacre correlated positively with education level; 15%, 18%, 25% and 29%, respectively. Similar patterns were observed across socio-vocational groups: 27% of repondents employed as directorial staff or as part of the inteligencja indicated they believed that poles were partially culpable; only 11 and 13% of skilled workers and farmers responded similarly. Moreover, those who worked as laborers or had only a primary or vocational education were were markedly more rigid in their beliefs. A follow-up survey conducted in August 2001 revealed that the number of respondents with a higher education who believed that only Germans were culpable decreased from 35% to 19%, and the percent of those who believed that Poles were somewhat culpable increased from 29% to 52%. Conversely, those with only a primary education actually became slightly less likely to believe Poles were culpable, and slightly likelier to believe that only Germans were involved. The number directorial staff and inteligencja who believed that only Germans were culpable decreased from 43% to 14%, and the percent who beleived that Poles were partially culpable increased 25% to 57%. 

Overwhelmingly, respondents in April--before the official expiation act of July 10--opposed any official act of expiation (48% in opposition, 30% in favor). And, when official ceremonies were held on July 10, 38% of respondents reported that they had followed media coverage event. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, similar educational and socio-vocational traits patterned respondents: Of those who followed the event, a majority had a higher education (54%) or were representatives of directorial staff and inteligencja (46%). This demographic was also the most optimistic that the controversy over the Jedwabne massacre would ultimately strengthen Polish-Jewish relations.
