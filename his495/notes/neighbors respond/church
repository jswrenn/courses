A Poor Christian Looks at Jedwabne <155>

# Tygodnik Powszechny:
In letter published by episcopate on aniversary of Nostra Aetate: "Unfortunately, that shame land [oland] has become in our century a grave for several million Jews. This was neither by our will, nor by our hand".
After Gross's book about Jedwabne, is last sentence still accurate?

# Archbishop Henryk Muszynski:
"The Hollocaust really was not carried out by our hand, nor was it by our will. This sentence has been questioned, unforutnately by many Jews.
Same letter stated: "If even one Christian was able to help, but did not extaend a helpping hand to a Jew in a time of danger, or caused his death, we are required to ask our sister and brother Jews for forgivenes"
"discussion around Gross's book is the consequence of those words."
"I am not a historian, so it is diffucult me to assess the extent to which Neighbors is one-sided, tendentious, or incomplete."
"historical truth" [is it important]
"But regardless of whether it turns out that 1,600 or 160 Jews were burned, a chrim is still a crime. Someone said, and this pained me greatly, that its enough to cross out one zero from the number of victims Gross gives in hsi book"

On collective reponsibility: "For any crime, it is the direct perpetrator who is answerable; but, those who are connected to him by religous or national ties--though they bear no personal guilt--cannot feel themselves ot be free of responsibility for the victims of this murder."

#Powszechny: The direct perpentrators where Polish residents of Jedwabne?
#Muszynski: *some* of the residents. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instigators and Perpetrators?
#Powszechny:
Waserztaijn, Gross's main witness, speaks openly of an order given by the germans. Adds :"Even though it was the Germans who gaves this order, Polish hooligans took it and carried it out in the crueest ossible manner"

#Muszynski:
Both indirect perpetrators and instigators bear moral responsibility


#Powszechny: <157>
"One could say that the Germans have rekoned with their own past, that they have taken responsibility for the holocaust. ForPoles, information about the participation of their compatriots in the murder of Jews came as a shock..."
#Muszynski:
Poles can't take responsibility for Holocaust, because they didn't do it. 
Regarding murder of jews:
    historical truth was falsified first by Nazi ideology
    falsified a second time by Comunist ideologiy
    
See Katyn: soviet crime ascribed to the Germans
Auschwitz: number of jewish victims were reduced

we were ordered to pray at some monuments and forbidden to pray at others.

"Thats why, when I saw on television the old monument inJedwabne had been taken down, I saw it as beginning of the end of era of falsification, instrumentalization, and the ideologizing of the truth. Because the truth has been instrumentalized. The truth was that which served Communist ideology.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Powszechny:
"That is one aspect. Another is the psychologically understanble resistance to the recognition that oles--victims of Nazism--could also be culprits. We are indignant and outranged when we are reminded that we looked on the tragedy of the ghetto with indifference, not to mention upon reading Gross" <157>

#Muszynski:
"the idea that we were the victims of Hitlers nazissm was and deeply rooted"

Durign pperiod of german occupation, two basic categories distinguished: perpentrators and victims
    Poles and jews were the victims, but
    not in the same way and not to the same degree"
    
"The antagonism of suffering"

Rabbi Schudrich said that jews were not just victims, but that there were among them "bad peole who harmed others"--cting in the service of the Commmunists or even the Nazis.  <158>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Powszechny:
"We recall the expectation that German bishops would apologize to us, although they were not SS men"

#Muszynski:
Nah, man, it's tottttallly different. Nazisim was in the name of Germany. Jedwabne was commited by poles, but not in the name of Polish People. 

To receive God's forgiveness, everyone who had commited a chrime or a sin against another must stand in the full truth before mankind as well" <159>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Powszechny:
You say that communists falsified history, but didn't they conduct an investigation?

#Muszynski:
"After reading Neighbors, I had the impression that the trial in the JEdwabne case was rather a farse. 
"truth in the service of ideology"

#Powszechny:
In many reports, Pole appears to the Jew as tha threat

#Muszynski:
Rescuing a jew carried sentince of death for entire family


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cleansing Through Truth

#Powszechny:
What can the Church do in the matter of Jedwabne?

#Muszynski:
If we had appologized then, it would have been taken as a regognition of guilt for the so-called Polish antisemitism <160>

Primate appologized for loass of love for people, which led some in the priesthood to "tolerate manifestations of antisemitism"

Polish jewish reconciliation has not yet begun; we are still in the stage of blaming each other

Now, I think we're ready for a joint plane of understanding.
