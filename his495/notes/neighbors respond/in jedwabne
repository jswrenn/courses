Introduction: Jedwabne in Jedwabne <181>

Differing Views

Stanislaw Przechodzki
    Head of branch of Public Health Center for Podlasie in Lomza
    Born in 1955, not direct observer of events, but informed by his parents
    Argued their could be no responsibility but:
    "There can be only one turth in a fundamental issue. The murdered was carreid out by some neighbors. That was the main murder--the burning in the barn- but there were also main, very many, individual murders. There is no doubt that they were comiited with the approval of the Germans. But to talk of dozens or hundreds of armed gendarmes in Jedwabne is a mockery of the victims. There wasn ocordon of Germns around Jedwabne"
    Town faced diffucult task:
    "They will have to accept the truth of the events that, though they happened in the distant past, are neverless a tragedy that his very close to them today. But before that, they will have to repare themselves by undergoing an internal mental change ... If the people of jedwabne do nothing but entrench themselves and defend themselves agaisnt attacks, if they shut themselves up in their own hell, their defense of the good name of their town will be nothing but a macker y of a defense. On the part of the eople of Jedwbne themselves, there should be more sensible, premenditated actions. We should show that we have  already understood something and that we have changed."
    
Father Edward Orlowski, Parish priest,
    "Let us tell the whole truth: change must occur on both sides, and not just oone. For ddialogue aplies by both sides. By blaming only one side, we will always be biased.
    
    Argued that polish jewish relations had been harmonius until the outbreak of the war, but after 1939 "the soviet used the jews against ppoland". 
    
    "Later, when the Germans came, they tried to use the Poles against the Jewish community. One cannot say that the crime was commited by Poles. What hapened in Jedwabne also happened all over Europe. However, it annot be excluded that some poles were compelled to take part in this crime, others felt like exacting revenge on the Jews, and some may have been ordinary criminals. It is also diffucult to accept that Polish society as a whole treated the Jews so cruelly. if it is only individuals who did so, they did so as part of german operations"

# Nosowski:

# Godlewski:
Jedwabne has tow planes: moral and politicaal
Jedwabne has played host to series of journalists
    Some want the truth
    others want a sensationalist article
    
"First come the questions" 
    "How many perished and where"
"The tragedy is becoming a game in the hands of the media and politicians"

# Przechodzki:
Some people are trying to profit from the tragedy."
"Soemwhere in the rush of words, the human being is lost"
"Jedwabne is a small place. Everyone here knows everyone else, and the tragedy conserns everyone" <187
"There is no antisemitism in Jedwabne
    There is in larger towns,k but "simle people liver here"
    "Nevertheless, certain anti-Jewish elements remain insidetthem, shaped by the history of the interwar period or the war itself. But this is not the aggressive antisemitism that can be found among certian ppolitical groups or in some newspapers." 
    [Folk antisemitism!?]

# Borkowicz:
How did the eole here remember the events before Burnt offering?

# Przechodzki:
"For most young people here, they were so remote that they seemed to have occured hundreds of years ago. They were in the past, and that was that."
"Out arents didn't tell us everything"
"We knew that beside the cemetary there was a barn in which the jews were burned."
"I kknew a lot of details that do tnot apear there. But they make no difference to the spirt of that book

# Michalowski:
I, too, was born here. Heard a conversation when I was young.
Gross's book remindede me of it. Took a whole new dimension.

# Przechodzki: <188>
"Thos who live here and come from here whill neer be the same people that they were a year ago. Even at home, among my family, I feel different from how I felt last year, even though I am not to blame for what happened sixty years ago."
"The Jedwabne that existed before May 2000 is gone"
Difficult task:
    Accept truth of events, while distant, arestill relevant
    First: must undergo a mental change
"One must remember that the overwhelming majority of the population here consists of ordinary people
"Downright lie to portray them as simple peasent folk who dont read and who live in a village dominated by the all-encompassing eight of the church" <188>

# Nosowski:
"when yo usaid, 'we will never be the same again,' everyone nodded in agreement. What has changed?"

# Przechodzki:
"Jedwabne is no longer just another polish  town, one of thousands"
We are now on the lips of the world. That creates a very onerous psychological burden.
How are we capable of changing?
What sort of truth should they accept?

"In some people, knowledge of the tragedy, even though it happened so long ago, still rouses misgivings"
They try to interpret it in their own way--not always in accordence with the truth-- with the intention of protecting their families"
"One always tries to seek an excuse

Soviets used ethnic minorities against majority <189>

"After reading some articles, one might get the impression that eastern-poland in the period of 1939-1941 was under Jewish occupation, and not soviet occupation. I did not think it was possible to alter history so much in the space of a few months".

# Michalowski:  <189>
Parents were deported
People say Jews handed poles over to NKVD, but his family was handed over by a neighbor, a pole.

# Przechodzki:
Dismisses collective guilt.
Cannot blame entire Jewish community of Jedwabne for deeds of a few jews during soviet terror.
Same applies to massacre.
This was not an entire society
"No one knew what Nazism would bring, so the German forces received a warm welcome in many places. They were treated as liberators from Soviet occupation."


# Michalowski
I, as a pole, bear moral responsibility
I do not agree that involvement of Germans was marginal
One should not apply collective responsibility." 
"Over 95 percent of Jedwabne's preasent population came hear after the war. These people have no connection with the events of the summer of 1941."
[Numerical Minority, Moral Majority]
"The element of fear that paralyzed the Jews also affected the Poles in a certain sense."
"They included people known for an inclination to hooliganism and banditry before the war"

# Orlowski <190>
"I would like to corect a distortion in Gross's book"

# Czajkowski:
Whose truth?
"good must be givin a chance, so that the world does not associate Jedwabne soley with the evil that happened here."

# Godlewski: <191>
"Woe could accept the turth if only we knew it in full. FOr instance, if the exact number of Jews were established. But that unfortunate number of 1,600 Jews has been pulled out of a hat."

"Whatever I say on this subject, I offend someone's sense of what is sacred"
By askig questiosn about my identity, I enter conflcit with my own father.

# Godlewski:
Let us tell the whole truth, change must occur on both sides, not not just one. 
"Here, the jeews and poles coexisted well"
Young jews supported communism, and the Soviets used the Jews against Poland. Later, when the Germans came, they tried to use the Poles against the Jewish Community"
"What happened in Jedwabne also hapened all over Europe"

# Czakowski: What did he say about the murder itself? <192>

# Orlowski:
3 days, jews were rounded up to weed the grass and clean the park
no one knew how it would end because Poles were hurdered into square on the critical day.
People peeked out of windows. 
Priest stood at gateway leading to church and watched.
"The fear was pervasive"

# Czajkowski: Couldn'e he have intervened?

# Orlowski:
Before the barn was burned, he went up to an officer and asked "what harm have womean and children done to you
Officer replied "Maybe you don't know whos in charnge here."

# Nosowski:
Conflcit between factual and moral planes. You speak of the motives, but do they justify the actions?

# Orlowski: "Nothing can justify murder". <192>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Orlowski:
Cites example of jewish and german cemetaries not being tended to <193>
    "I protested from the ppulpit"
    
# Czajkowski: But we're talking about a community gesture

# Orlowski: At this moment, that is perhaps impossible.

# Godlewski:
As for looking after the Jewish graves, there might still be some psychological barriers in the minds of the peole of Jedwabne, but I see no such danger in the minds of young people. they already think in different terms. FOr them there are neither Jews, nor Romans, nor Greeks. That initiative could launch the building of not just one but several small memorials in the hearts of these young people, much more durable than stone. 

There is stil la polarization reviews. One one hand, we are defending ourselves against historical accusation. On the other hand, goverment is planning major ceremonies.
"Let woulrd opinions see us as openminded and responsible catholics.

# Borkowicz: <194>
People of Jedwabne should be aware that gesture on their part does not mean that they are confessing to the crime; it's merely an expression of responsibility for the pplace where they live.

# Godlewski:

Remember how governments proposed version of inscription ended:
    "Forgive us, as we have forgiven others"
    But if we think we don't share any of the guilt, what is the sense of that sort of forgiveness?
    
"Father Orlowski has his information, and we have hours. How are we to tell who is right?"
"I am confinced that the Poles played a considerable ppart in this crime."
"They should be named, and they alone should be tried. Except thatno one is able to do this"

# Orlowski: They are either dead or old.

# Godlewski: 
Do we accept the legacy of those thirty people? Do we distance ourselves from it? Do we apologize?

# Marczuk: "I agree with the nmayor. There are no good or bad nations, only good and bad people"
# Borkowicz: In the same way there are no good or bad towns"

# Marczuk: 
"Pope stresses that one cannot blame entire Jewish people for the death of Christ. I think the same principal ought to be applied to jedwabne"

# Norsowiski: <195>
How do children and young peole ask thier parents about what hapened in 1941

# Michalowski:
I witnessed five year old listening to a conversation among adults then asking:
"Listen Grandfather, was it you who murdered those jews, or your dad, or my dad?"
YOu cant brush these adide.

# Godlewiski
"Whenever I think seriously about this crime, I lose my equilibrium, and emotions get the upper hand"

"We in jedwabne don't need either psychologists or sociologists. Anyone who is incapable of reacting ot these horrros on his own is beyodn integration of society

# Nosowiski:
I understand you want to name a school after Antonina Wyrzykowska, who rescued seven jews

# Godlewski
To my surprise, for our children this subject was entirely abstract. Should we "make them happy" by digging up old matters/

# Czajkowski:
Children whould find out anyhow. 
One should also show them the beautiful side of history

# Godlewski: <196>
It was just an idea.
"The school is not ready for it yet"
He's not in charge of name change either.
Several organizations, made of people, with families, with memories.

# Borkowicz:
Gross writes about Wyzykowski family ina footnote; I hope a book will be written aboout them
I do not think anyoen will every write such a book. 
That is how the logic of the emdia works, unfortunately. Evil is more attractive than good"

# Godlewski
I consider it my duty to mediate.
"If we all make sure that such events never happen again, those deaths will nto have been in vain"

# Nosowksi: Do you pray for the murdered jews?

# Orlowski (misspelled)
I feel responsible for entire hisoty of my parish.
They stand, deeply shamed before the same god.

# Czajkowski:
"it is a shame that they were reconciled only after their deaths"

# Orlowski:
If necessary, I will take up a collecition, etc...

# Godlewski <197>
Church is imbued with "wisdom of a thousand years but these are tiems of change
I have three children
    their religious views are different from mine
    completely different from my father's
    
# Czajkowski
"Perhaps there is no such thing as collective guilt, but every community needs a kind of collective responsibility"
"Can anyone say the pope does not love the church because he discusses its sins?"

# Godlewski:
Resolving this issue and explaining it in full will bring us more benefit than keeping it secret

# Przechodzki:
"There can be only one turth in a fundamental issue. The murdered was carreid out by some neighbors. That was the main murder--the burning in the barn- but there were also main, very many, individual murders. There is no doubt that they were comiited with the approval of the Germans. But to talk of dozens or hundreds of armed gendarmes in Jedwabne is a mockery of the victims. There wasn ocordon of Germns around Jedwabne"

"Just before the barn was burned, my mother, with a baby in her arms, walked throgu hthe entire town and left it unhindered. NOwhere did she see any Germans. One kilometer away from jedwabne, she heard the screams of the burning victims. It was so piercing that she remembers it to this day"

# Marczuk:
35 years ago, polish bishops addressed germans:
    "We forgive and we ask for forgiveness
    Caused heated reaction.
    Apologized not because we owe someone guilt, but because we require purification
    " he who utters these words first is the wiser

# Czajkowski: <198>
No one expects the parishoners here to go to confessionals and confess to the evil of 1941 as their own personal sin.

# Michalowski:
"Being continually lectured to arouses a feeling of being under threat in the local community"
Only natural to defend.

# Borkowicz
"Jedwabne is becoming a symbol, whether we like it or not."
Irrespective of # of perpentrators
irr. of coercian or inspiration, massacre was commited by polish hands.
The murders were Poles. 
"I do not agreee with the reverend father that the same thing happened all over Europe"
"Jedwabne was not typical. If it were ,it would never have become the symbol that it now is."
"Of course, Jedwabne is no excetion either.

"Charactaristic feature of a symbol is that it 'falls' in one place'
    We need to come to terms with it.
    We might be able to excercise soem influence over the form of the smbol
    
# Michalowski: 
Such reflection cannot be introduced externally, even if it is wise"

# Przechodzki:
Acceptance/rejection of the truth will change people here
it will change the way the outside world looks at jedwaabne

Leave it to historians to discover the causes of those conflics,. They had but one outcome--a tragic one. 

If we do nothing but entrench ourselvess, we'll be morally isolated.

"It is enough that we ourselves are tormented"
