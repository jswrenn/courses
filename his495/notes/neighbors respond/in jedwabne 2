Although the testimony of Szmuel Waserztajn provided the impetus for the early legal investigations into the Jedwabne massacre, a treatment of the massacre corroborating his statements (which incriminated the Polish inhabitants of Jedwabne) was not produced until after his death on February 9, 2000. Later that Spring, Gross's article "Lato 1941 w Jedwabnem. Przyczynek do badań nad udziałem społeczności lokalnych w eksterminacji narodu żydowskiego w latach II wojny światowej" (Summer 1941 in Jedwabne: A contribution to research on the role of local societies in the extermination of the Jewish nation in the years of the Second World War) appeared in the festschrift dedicated to Tomasz Strzembosz, the leading historian on Polish-Jewish relations in the Bialystok region, Europa nieprowincjonalna. The article, for the most part, was a presentation of Szmuel Waserztajn's testimony without much additional historical work. Gross expanded his study of Jedwabne in an english-language paper entitled "Jews and Their Polish Neighbors: The Case of jedwabne during the Soviet Occupation in the SUmmer of 1941," presented at the conference "Polish-Jewish Relations during and after the Holocaust--New Approaches," held at New York's Yeshiva University. 

The publication of these articles germinated renewed interest in the massacre in both Poland and the United States. On May 5, Andrzej Kaszynski published "Calopalenie", the first of his articles referencing Gross's research, in Rzeczpospolita, a leading Polish daily newspaper. Morlan Ty Rogers, twenty-seven of who's relatives perished in the massacre, reproduced the article in English as "Burning Alive" on his website. Although the publication of Neighbors is usually cited as the begining of the controversy over the Jedwabne event, a nascent debate in fact grew in the ensuing weeks after Kaszynski's article. The Town Council of Jedwabne took its first steps undertook a revevaluation of the massacre on May 8, and by May 13, articles published in the Nationalistic daily Nasz Dziennik accused Daczynski and Gross of "propogating 'lies'".

Gross's monograph, "Sasiedza. Historio zaglady zydowskiego miasteczka," published on May 21, 2000, expanded his earlier non-critical retelling of Waserztajn's testimony of the Jedwabne controversy into a complete narrative of events by corroborating it with the testimonies of the 1949 trials. Gross traces the beginning of the pogrom to the morning of July 10, when all of Jedwabne's Catholic adult males were called to to assemble outside the Jedwabne town hall. Gross surmises that there must have been some prior knowledge of what was to occur, as carts carrying people from nearby hamlets had been arriving since dawn. The assembled men "were equipped by the German gendarmerie and Karolak and Sobuta with whips and clubs. Then Karolak and Sobuta ordered the assembled men to bring ot the swuare in front of the town hall all the Jews of Jedwabne." <N56> The Jews were thusly ordered to assemble to the market square for cleaning duty. Such an order was not entirely out of the ordinary in Jewish-Polish relations of that period. Gross's narrative divides the subsequent events into four approximate phases: hunting, humiliation, holocaust and plunder.
	
Apparently cognizant that what was to ensue was not, in fact, 'cleaning duty', several hundred Jews attempted to escape. A band of teenagers brought captured Nielawicki as he attempted to flee across the fields to Wizna; he was beaten and brought to the square. Olszewicz, another Jewish survivor the pogrom, has his first escape thwarted similarly by roaming guards; he too was beaten and brought to the square. In all, Gross estimates between 100 and 200 Jews escaped from Jedwabne. Of those caught, some were brought to the square as Nielawicki and Olszewicz were, but most were killed on the spot. Testimonies singled out a member of the Kobrzyniecki family, first name historically unknown, as the most effective killer of this phase; in two separate testimonies, he is described as gutting eighteen Jews with a knife. 
	
Those who did not attempt to flee were subjected to humiliating acts. A dozen Jews were ordered by Sobuta and Wasilewski "to do some ridiculous gymnastic exercises." Another group was ordered to fell a statue of Lenin errected by the Soviets during the previous period of occupation. " When the jews broke the stature, they were told to put its varisus pieces on some boards and carry it around, and the rabbi was told to walk in front with his hat on a stick, and all had to sing, 'The war is because of us, the war is for us.'" <N62>
	
Gross surmised that, having realized the relative ineffectiveness of piecmeal killings, the participants sought a more efficient method of execution. X recalled, "When I came to the square, they told me to give my barn to burn the Jews, to which I started pleading to spare my barn." Another barn was used, instead. "While varying the statue , all the Jews were chased toward the barn, and the barn was doused with gasoline and lit, and in this manner fifteen hundred Jewish people perished." <N22> The aforementioned member of the Kobrzyniecki family is identified as having lit the barn on fire. Three Jews entrapped in the barn managed to escape; Janek Neumark, his sister and daughter were pressed against the barn door when a blast of hot air blew it open. Though their exit was bared by Staszek Sielawa, wielding an axe, the trio managed to disarm him and make it to the cemetery, where they hid.
	
Having ridden the town of most of it's Jews, the remaining inhabitants of Jedwabne found themselves grossly unprepared for the aftermath. The hot July weather fueled fears that an epidemic would ravage the town unless the corpses were disposed of with haste. The manager of Jedwabne's Gendarme accused the mayor of over-promising in a public confrontation: "You insisted that you'd put things in order with the Jews, but you don't know how to put things in order at all." <N65> The plunder of Jewish property now began, a phase to which Gross devoted an entire chapter to. Those responsible for burying the corpses searched through the singed clothing for hidden valuables. Although the gendarmie attempted to seize found property, "anyone who hid it in his shoe saved the catch." <N64>

In the narration of the pogrom itself, Gross's own voice is sparsely heard; rather, he strings together the first-hand accounts of the pogrom in a cohesive manner. Although the testimonies of pogrom survivors such as Wasersztejn inspired Neighbor's alternative reading of the sources, they are not the primary testimonies heard in Neighbors. Nor does Gross focus on the most violent participants of the pogrom, those who set the barn ablaze or murdered Jews individually. Rather, filled with the accounts of those who stood by—the neighbors who refused shelter, who pedaled the property of the murdered Jews, and who harassed the very in Jedwabne few who protected Jews—Neighbors aligned complacency with collaboration. While this association is implicit (albeit, inescapable) during Gross's narration of the pogrom itself, Gross takes the additional step of devoting the succeeding chapters to a discussion of the moral ramifications of his findings and their context in broader Polish-Jewish relations.

Although the publication of Neighbor's was not, as some have said, an unprecedented spark to an unprecedented debate, it is notable that, unlike all previous treatments of the Jedwabne massacre, Gross's thesis succeeded in penetrating the public conscience. In the following few months, the academic debate of the Jedwabne controversy produced more journal articles than had been penned in it's fifty-year historiographic legacy--that's to say nothing of the popular outcry. Although scarcely new evidence of Jedwabne event has emerged since Neighbors, a slew of widely different narratives of the day's events emegred. Admist such a sudden outburst of debate, it seems unlikely that the ferocity of the debate over the Jedwabne massacre merely reflected a national appetite for history.

By the time Andrzej Kaszynski and Gabriela Szczesna visted Jedwabne in preparations for their May 5th and May 7th articles in Rzeczpospolita and Kontakty, respectively, a shift in the relationship between the town's inhabitants and the massacre had already begun. Since 1999, a small number of the Town's inhabitant's had gathered annually on July 10 at the site of the pogrom's memorial for a candlelight vigil. Whatever advancements had been made, unfettered dialog was not among them; Kaszynski reported difficulty in extracting statements from inhabitants. 

If Jedwabne's inhabitants were co-conspirators, it was not a conspiracy of igonrance they participated in, but one of silence. The elderly persons interviewed by Kaszynski generally confirmed Waserztajn's account of events insofar that Poles were foremost among the perpentrators. Henryek Adamczyk, twelve at time time of the massacre recalled, "My parents ordered me to hide but I can still hear the screaming of the Jews being led to their death, and I can smell the stench of the burning." Her husband, Eugeniusz Adamczyk, two tended to the memorial erected by the ZBoWid and was the first commander of the Citizen's Militia post in Jedwabne, recalled arresting three suspected perpetrators of the massacre and delivering them for interrogation to Lomza.

Both Kaszynski and Szczesna found that knowledge of the massacre crossed generations. In his interview with Szczensa, Krzysztof Godlewski, the mayor of Jedwabne, recalled, "the memory of them was constantly kept alive for us by Marianna Gosiewska, a prewar teacher. Krystyna Raszczyk, born after the massacre, learned of it from her grandfather: "A few Jews were able to escape from the column of death. I know this from my grandfather. Five of them hid in his orchard. Among them were Hancia and Szmujel; he could see who was murdering his son. Szmujel also told Grandfather that before herding them into the barn, the Poles ordered the Jews to remove their shoes good clothes, and jewelry." <NR1> Indeed, Kaszynski reported that, "When our photographer approached some youngsters gathered in the town square and asked them to point out any mementos of the Jedwabne jews, or the monument to them, they first asked with a hint of sarcasm whether he had come to take back the property that formerly belonged to the Jews."

Jedwabne's modern-day inhabitants remained fiercly protective of the reputation of their town, and their own reputation. Invariably, Kaszynski was assured that "none of the murderers is still alive." That was not to say that the memory of the massacre died with them. Jerzy Ramotowski, a secondary-school teacher in Jedwabne, reported that in the ensuing decades, "the names of the murderers have remained an open secret." The mayor noted his reluctance to exhume the Jedwabne massacre: "The truth is sacred. [...] However, i'm not in favor of simply naming the perpetrators of the crime [...] wounds should be left to heal and not be opened anew." <NR63>





What ever opprotunties Kaszynski enjoyed in his research ended on May 5th--his visit to the town was among the last times--if not the very last time--that the town was visited in a 'pristine' state. For better or worse, Calopalenie hung a magnifing glass over the small town of Jedwabne--one through which the eyes of the world peered. 

"Sincethat 10 July 1941, the names of the murderes have remained an open secret,"

"A few Jews were able to escape from the column of death," says Krystyna Raszczyk. "I know this from my grandfather. Five of them hid in his orchard. Among them were Hancia and Szmujel; he could see who was murdering his son. Szmujel also told Grandfather that before hearding them into the bar, the Poles ordered the Jews to remove their shoes, good clothes, and jewelry." <NR61>

"My family always had acquaintances and good friends among the jews. My best friend at school




To that point, what stirrings of memory had occured among the inhabitants had been mostly of their own volition. 


Among the elderly persons interviewed by Kaszynski



Generally, those who spoke to Kaszynski confirmed Waserztajn's account of events. 


<NR63-Szczensa> "The truth is sacred. It's obvious that the inscrition must be changed." says the mayor. "However, I'm not in favor of simply naming the perpetrators of the crime. The assasins from Jedwabne were a handful."

<NR65-kaczynska> "we've been coming here for hree years now and we light small cnaldes" says an eldly woman from Jedwabne who was eight years old on 10 July 1941. 

Jedwabne mayor Krzystof Godlewski and the town and district chairman Stanislaw Michalowski came ot the monument yestrrday before noon. They bought a mourining weath with a ribbon decorated with the words "For the murdered jedwabne residents of Jewish nationality, in memory and admonition--society"

Presence of residents, journalists, and a crew from olish national television. 

Godlewski -- "an investigation should be conducted and the truth should be established, one to which we will adhere. We cannot allowthe new monument to divide peole. This monument should unify and not divide. It should be a warning for the future.

Michalowski: "We've been stuck with the reputation of a criminal town. This is unfair. As in every community, different kinds of people lived here. We must differentiate the criminals from the nomral people. This was just as much a tragedy for the latter as for those murdered.
