Although the testimony of Szmuel Waserztajn provided the impetus for the early legal investigations into the Jedwabne massacre, a treatment of the massacre corroborating his statements (which incriminated the Polish inhabitants of Jedwabne) was not produced until after his death on February 9, 2000. Later that Spring, Gross's article "Lato 1941 w Jedwabnem. Przyczynek do badań nad udziałem społeczności lokalnych w eksterminacji narodu żydowskiego w latach II wojny światowej" (Summer 1941 in Jedwabne: A contribution to research on the role of local societies in the extermination of the Jewish nation in the years of the Second World War) appeared in the festschrift dedicated to Tomasz Strzembosz, the leading historian on Polish-Jewish relations in the Bialystok region, Europa nieprowincjonalna. The article, for the most part, was a presentation of Szmuel Waserztajn's testimony without much additional historical work. Gross expanded his study of Jedwabne in an english-language paper entitled "Jews and Their Polish Neighbors: The Case of jedwabne during the Soviet Occupation in the SUmmer of 1941," presented at the conference "Polish-Jewish Relations during and after the Holocaust--New Approaches," held at New York's Yeshiva University. 

The publication of these articles germinated renewed interest in the massacre in both Poland and the United States. On May 5, Andrzej Kaszynski published "Calopalenie", the first of his articles referencing Gross's research, in Rzeczpospolita, a leading Polish daily newspaper. Morlan Ty Rogers, twenty-seven of who's relatives perished in the massacre, reproduced the article in English as "Burning Alive" on his website. Although the publication of Neighbors is usually cited as the begining of the controversy over the Jedwabne event, a nascent debate in fact grew in the ensuing weeks after Kaszynski's article. The Town Council of Jedwabne took its first steps undertook a revevaluation of the massacre on May 8, and by May 13, articles published in the Nationalistic daily Nasz Dziennik accused Daczynski and Gross of "propogating 'lies'".

Gross's monograph, "Sasiedza. Historio zaglady zydowskiego miasteczka," published on May 21, 2000, expanded his earlier non-critical retelling of Waserztajn's testimony of the Jedwabne controversy into a complete narrative of events by corroborating it with the testimonies of the 1949 trials. Gross traces the beginning of the pogrom to the morning of July 10, when all of Jedwabne's Catholic adult males were called to to assemble outside the Jedwabne town hall. Gross surmises that there must have been some prior knowledge of what was to occur, as carts carrying people from nearby hamlets had been arriving since dawn. The assembled men "were equipped by the German gendarmerie and Karolak and Sobuta with whips and clubs. Then Karolak and Sobuta ordered the assembled men to bring ot the swuare in front of the town hall all the Jews of Jedwabne." <N56> The Jews were thusly ordered to assemble to the market square for cleaning duty. Such an order was not entirely out of the ordinary in Jewish-Polish relations of that period. 
	
Gross's narrative divides the subsequent events into four approximate phases: hunting, humiliation, holocaust and plunder. Apparently cognizant that what was to ensue was not, in fact, 'cleaning duty', several hundred Jews attempted to escape. A band of teenagers brought captured Nielawicki as he attempted to flee across the fields to Wizna; he was beaten and brought to the square. Olszewicz, another Jewish survivor the pogrom, has his first escape thwarted similarly by roaming guards; he too was beaten and brought to the square. In all, Gross estimates between 100 and 200 Jews escaped from Jedwabne. Of those caught, some were brought to the square as Nielawicki and Olszewicz were, but most were killed on the spot. Testimonies singled out a member of the Kobrzyniecki family, first name historically unknown, as the most effective killer of this phase; in two separate testimonies, he is described as gutting eighteen Jews with a knife. 
	
Those who did not attempt to flee were subjected to humiliating acts. A dozen Jews were ordered by Sobuta and Wasilewski "to do some ridiculous gymnastic exercises." Another group was ordered to fell a statue of Lenin errected by the Soviets during the previous period of occupation. " When the jews broke the stature, they were told to put its varisus pieces on some boards and carry it around, and the rabbi was told to walk in front with his hat on a stick, and all had to sing, 'The war is because of us, the war is for us.'" <N62>
	
Gross surmised that, having realized the relative ineffectiveness of piecmeal killings, the participants sought a more efficient method of execution. X recalled, "When I came to the square, they told me to give my barn to burn the Jews, to which I started pleading to spare my barn." Another barn was used, instead. "While varying the statue , all the Jews were chased toward the barn, and the barn was doused with gasoline and lit, and in this manner fifteen hundred Jewish people perished." <N22> The aforementioned member of the Kobrzyniecki family is identified as having lit the barn on fire. Three Jews entrapped in the barn managed to escape; Janek Neumark, his sister and daughter were pressed against the barn door when a blast of hot air blew it open. Though their exit was bared by Staszek Sielawa, wielding an axe, the trio managed to disarm him and make it to the cemetery, where they hid.
	
Having ridden the town of most of it's Jews, the remaining inhabitants of Jedwabne found themselves grossly unprepared for the aftermath. The hot July weather fueled fears that an epidemic would ravage the town unless the corpses were disposed of with haste. The manager of Jedwabne's Gendarme accused the mayor of over-promising in a public confrontation: "You insisted that you'd put things in order with the Jews, but you don't know how to put things in order at all." <N65> The plunder of Jewish property now began, a phase to which Gross devoted an entire chapter to. Those responsible for burying the corpses searched through the singed clothing for hidden valuables. Although the gendarmie attempted to seize found property, "anyone who hid it in his shoe saved the catch." <N64>

In the narration of the pogrom itself, Gross's own voice is sparsely heard; rather, he strings together the first-hand accounts of the pogrom in a cohesive manner. Although the testimonies of pogrom survivors such as Wasersztejn inspired Neighbor's alternative reading of the sources, they are not the primary testimonies heard in Neighbors. Nor does Gross focus on the most violent participants of the pogrom, those who set the barn ablaze or murdered Jews individually. Rather, filled with the accounts of those who stood by—the neighbors who refused shelter, who pedaled the property of the murdered Jews, and who harassed the very in Jedwabne few who protected Jews—Neighbors aligned complacency with collaboration. While this association is implicit (albeit, inescapable) during Gross's narration of the pogrom itself, Gross takes the additional step of devoting the succeeding chapters to a discussion of the moral ramifications of his findings and their context in broader Polish-Jewish relations.

Although the publication of Neighbor's was not, as some have said, an unprecedented spark to an unprecedented debate, it is notable that, unlike all previous treatments of the Jedwabne massacre, Gross's thesis succeeded in penetrating the public conscience. In the following few months, the academic debate of the Jedwabne controversy produced more journal articles than had been penned in it's fifty-year historiographic legacy--that's to say nothing of the popular outcry. Although scarcely new evidence of Jedwabne event has emerged since Neighbors, a slew of widely different narratives of the day's events emegred. Admist such a sudden outburst of debate, it seems unlikely that the ferocity of the debate over the Jedwabne massacre merely reflected a national appetite for history.

# The Silence of Jedwabne

By the time Andrzej Kaszynski and Gabriela Szczesna visted Jedwabne in preparations for their May 5th and May 7th articles in Rzeczpospolita and Kontakty, respectively, a shift in the relationship between the town's inhabitants and the massacre had already begun. Since 1999, a small number of the Town's inhabitant's had gathered annually on July 10 at the site of the pogrom's memorial for a candlelight vigil. Whatever advancements had been made unfettered dialog was not among them: Kaszynski reported difficulty in extracting statements from inhabitants. If, however, this difficulty reflected a conspiracy among Jedwabne's inhabitants, it was not a conspiracy of igonrance they participated in, but one of silence. The elderly persons interviewed by Kaszynski generally confirmed Waserztajn's account of events insofar that Poles were foremost among the perpentrators. Henryek Adamczyk, twelve at time time of the massacre recalled, "My parents ordered me to hide but I can still hear the screaming of the Jews being led to their death, and I can smell the stench of the burning." Her husband, Eugeniusz Adamczyk, two tended to the memorial erected by the ZBoWid and was the first commander of the Citizen's Militia post in Jedwabne, recalled arresting three suspected perpetrators of the massacre and delivering them for interrogation to Lomza.

Both Kaszynski and Szczesna found that knowledge of the massacre was shared, undistorted, by younger generations. Jedwabne mayor Krzysztof Godlewski, in his interview with Szczensa, recalled that "the memory of them was constantly kept alive for us by Marianna Gosiewska, a prewar teacher. Townsperson Krystyna Raszczyk, born after the massacre, learned of it from her grandfather: "A few Jews were able to escape from the column of death. I know this from my grandfather. Five of them hid in his orchard. Among them were Hancia and Szmujel; he could see who was murdering his son. Szmujel also told Grandfather that before herding them into the barn, the Poles ordered the Jews to remove their shoes good clothes, and jewelry." Moreover, a memory of the plunder of Jewish property still persisted. When Kaszynski's photographer asked a group of teenagers in the town square "to point out any mementos of the Jedwabne jews, or the monument to them, they first asked with a hint of sarcasm whether he had come to take back the property that formerly belonged to the Jews."

Invariably, Kaszynski was assured that "none of the murderers is still alive." Neither Kaszynski nor Szczesna encountered any individuals who admitted to direct involvement, nor did any other journalists before the end of that year. Like the final statements given in the trial, no townspeople recalled being in the group that led Jedwabne's Jews to the barn. Some, as Kaszynski and Szczesna encountered, recalled watching from a distance--a few reports of attempted aid emerged following the form, "I tried to give someone a cup of water, but some thug hit me on the hand with a club..." A question that emerged during the Soviet trials remegered: "Who was that thug?" Their identities did not die with them. Jerzy Ramotowski, a secondary-school teacher in Jedwabne, reported that in the ensuing decades, "the names of the murderers have remained an open secret"--open, perhaps, among Jedwabne's residents, but closed to prying journalists. Similarly, the mayor voiced his reluctance to exhume their identities: "The truth is sacred. [...] However, I'm not in favor of simply naming the perpetrators of the crime [...] wounds should be left to heal and not be opened anew." <NR63> Behind the facade of stoicism and reluctance reporters received, however, Jedwabne was ablaze with discussion.
    Quiet insider discussions are in progress in Jedwabne, and the visitor can only hear fragments of these opinions, a few facts here and there, and only on the condition that he switches off his camera or tape recorder and seems trustworthy. Then, he hears the names of those who forgot their fear of God, were tempted by Jewish property, and allowed themselves to fall under Satan's power. <Dobronski>
If collective guilt was an unreasonable framework with which to condemn the town (and most of Jedwabne's inhabitants believed it was) then surely, identifying the perpetrators was an avenue for resigning the massacre to the past. Why, then, the secrecy? "Dead or old," was the description of the perpetrators given by Father Orlowski, Jedwabne's town priest. Indeed, two of the fifteen persons convicted in the 1949 trials were still alive: Zygmunt Laudanski, eighty-two, sentenced to twelve years and served eight; and Jerzy, seventy-nine, sentenced to fifteen years and served eight. <NR268>

Whatever opportunities for unfettered research were enjoyed by Kaszynski and Szczesna on their visits to Jedwabne ended with the publication of their articles--their visits to the town were among the last times (if not the very last time) that the town was visited in a 'pristine' state. The publication of Kaszynski's Calopalenie in Rzeszpospolita, one of Poland's largest dailies, suspended a magnifying glass over the town of Jedwabne--one through which the eyes of the world peered. When the assemblage of local townspeople visited the Pogrom's memorial for the fourth annual commemoriative vigil on July 10, 2000, they were met by throngs of journalists and a crew from Polish national television. <NR65> In her coverage of the commemoration, Maria Kaczynska encountered a reluctance to speak of the massacre, just as Kaszynski and Szczesna did. She recalled her discussion with one elderly woman, who insisted on remaining anonymous:
    The woman states that she knows how the tragedy occured because she was standing about twelve meters from the blazing barn. Earlier she had seen how peole were dragged out of their homes in town. She also saw the murderers but will not say who they were. She refuses to give her own name, or to agree to meet a reporter for an interview. "Let the truth be discovered by those whose duty it is. I'm scared," she says, breaking off and wiping her tears. 
Unlike the resistance Kaszynski and Szczesna encountered, however, the reluctance bred in the months of intense public scrutiny was born out of a fear of guilt--not guilt in the infamous massacre, but a new crime: the defamation of Jedwabne. "We've been stuck with the reputation of a criminal town," stated town council chairman Michalowski. "This is unfair. [...] We must differentiate the criminals from the normal people. This was just as much a tragedy for the latter as for those murdered."

# Jedwabne's Tragedy 

Michalowski was likely referring to the pain endured by those in the town who survived their Jewish friends, but a secondary meaning may be extracted from his words. The controversy over the Jedwabne massacre had become an existential threat to modern-day Jedwabne. Indeed, within a year of the publication of Gross's first works on the Jedwabne massacre, this latter tragedy had overtaken the massacre in both consequence and urgency. The scars of international scrutiney on the village were the primary of a roundtable discussion between prominant Jedwabneans on February 22, 2001. "Those who live hear and come from here will never be the same people they were a year ago," said Stanislaw Przechodzki, to the agreement of the entire panel. "The Jedwabne that existed before May 2000 is gone." Under what Przechodzki called the "psychological burdon" of "being on the lips of the world," the cohesiveness of the village of Jedwabne stretched to a breaking point, with no clear escape. "Jedwabne is a small place. Everyone here knows everyone else, and the tragedy concerns everyone," Przechodzki said. What lay ahead for Jedwabne remained unclear, but it was unequivocal that neither silence nor ignorance remaiend tennable excuses for muting discussion. Roundtable participant Stanislaw Michalowski recalled, "I witnessed a five-year-old child listening to a conversation among adults, and then asking, 'Listen Grandfather, was it you who murdered those jews, or your dad, or my dad?'"

That Jedwabne had changed was perhaps the only point of unanimous agreement in the discussion. The February rountable highlighted the emergence of stark disagreements in how Jedwabne should relate to its past. Przechodzki, director of the Lomza branch of the Podlasie Public Health Center and former inhabitant of Jedwabne, represented the view that Jedwabne must undergo a radical self-reflection. "The people of Jedwabne are facing a diffcult task," he stated. "They will have to accept the truth of events that, though they happened in the distant past, are nevertheless a tragedy that is very close to them today. But before that, they will have to prepare themselves by undergoing an internal mental change." In Przechodzki's view, the "truth" that Jedwabne needed to accept was, rougly speaking, was the truth as presented by Jan Gross in Neighbors. Stanislaw Michalowski agreed, saying, "what happened in Jedwabhe 1941 is a painful but undeniable fact." As clear-cut as Przechodzki and Michalowski believed the truth to be, they acknowledged that the truth had not always been so unequivocal. Przechodzki contended that Jedwabne's present-day inhabitants had long been victims of self-deception: "They try to interpret [the massacre] in  their own way--not always in accordance with the truth--with the intention of protecting their families. These people will find it difficult to change and to accept the fact that certain events are irreversible. One always tries to seek an excuse."

Father Edward Orlowski, too, believed there was a crisis of historical denial, but not necessarily on the part of Poles: "Let us tell the whole truth; change must occur on both sides, and not just one." Orlowski's narrative of the massacre bore more similarities with Monkiewics's than Gross's:
    For three days, the Jews were rounded up to weed the grass and clean the park. No one intown knew how it would end because on the critical day they, too, were headed onto the square. On the day when that unfortunate barn burned, the parish priest stood at the gateway leading to the chruch and watched. The town square was almost empty. People were only peeking out of the windows or around corners. The fear was pervasive. 
Although Orlowski admitted that "it cannot be excluded that some Poles were compelled to take part in this crime," he proposed that it had, rather, been motivated by revenge: "We must admit the whole truth: Young Jews supported communism, and the Soviets used the Jews against Poland." <NR190>

The definitive truth--or lack thereof, rather--was, in fact, the "excuse" that enabled Jedwabne's inhabitants to avoid contending with the memory of the massacre. Jedwabne's very first official response in reaction to controversy over the massacre--coming only two days after the publication of Burnt Offering--was a statement that they had begun an investigation. On the 10 July 2000 commemoration, Mayor Godlewski reiterated the sentiment: "An investigation should be conducted and the truth should be established, one to which we will adhere." And lastly, Mayor Godlewski, whose role in the roundtable that of a mediator, lamanted "We could accept the truth if only we knew it in full. For instance, if the exact number of Jews were established." <NR191> To those of the pursuasion that guilt could not be ascribed until the truth was established--and this belief spanned the divisions of the Jedwabne controversy--no sure statements on guilt could be made. "On the basis of what Father Orlowski says," continued Godlewski, "we bear practically no guilt at all." <NR194> Convesely, if Gross's narrative held true, Przechodzki and Michalowski's condemnation of Jedwabne Poles would be correct. In the face of this unreconcillable moral divide, an exacebated Godlowski said, "Father Orlowski has his information, and we have ours. How are we to tell who is right?" <NR194> The official investigation, however, did not conclude until the Summer of 2002.

Seizing the absense of an official truth as an escape hatch from reconciling with a painful memory, the tragedy of the defamation of Jedwabne eclipsed the tragedy of the massacre. In an article "Jedwabne Stigmatized" published in December 2000, Adam Dobroński, professor at the University of Białystok, recalled the stresses of the crisis on Jedwabne:
    I am thinking back to a recent visit to Jedwabne to gather material for a television report. The town was living in fear. An invasion by journalists from all over the world was underway, and Jedwabne was consolidating a defense of its honor. Let me add that externally, the town could be any other town in this part of Poland, in other words: poor, with rising unemployment, and lost in everyday affairs.
That consolidated defense began on 4 March 2001 with the establishment of the Comittee to Defend the Good Name of Jedwabne. Mayor Godlewski, perhaps owing to his reputation as a mediator between the town and the Polish media, was named as chairman. Father Orlowski was also a prominent member. The comittee was to weigh proposals on how to preserve Jedwabne's reputation, and present its recommendations to the local and national governments. The committee fielded proposals from Godlewski, and Michal Kaminski of Lomza, a representative of the Zjednoczenie Chrzescijansko-Narodowe (ZChN--Christian National Union). In the nine months between the publication of Burnt Offering and March 4, the public relations crisis had been an easier--that is, less controversial--issue address. In his closing remarks at the February roundtable, Godlewski keenly noted the first cracks in this dam: "On one hand, we are defending ourselves against historical accusations, and on the other hand the government is preparing major ceremonies on 10 July. What would hapen if it turned out that we here are in opposition to all of this?" <NR194> On March 6, the dam burst. Following the committe's slection of Kaminski's proposal--to hold a protest against the "worldwide campaign of slander against Jedwabne and whole of Poland"--Godlewski resigned from the committee and was replaced as chair by Kaminski.

Meanwhile, the incursions of IPN investigators into Jedwabne intensified. On 30 May 2001, the Institute of Public Memory began its exhumation of the grave at the former site of the barn. In addition to representatives from the IPN, the exumation was presided over by Rabbi Menachem Ekstein of Israel, an expert of exhumation, Rabbi Michael Schudrich, the rabbi of Warsaw and Lodz, members of the Jewish community, Dr. William Haglund, director of Physicians for Human Rights. Although Haglund estimated that that exhumations on such a scale would require months, if not a year, of work, work was halted on June 3 owing to pressure from Jewish Orthodox groups. The unofficial report of an archeogist on the scene of 150-200 bodies, was widly repeted in Poland's right-wing press. The official report of Wiktor Kulesza of the IPN estimated that the grave contained between three-hundred and four-hundred bodies. Reports of the discovery of German bullets alongside fragments of the felled Lenin statue fueled premature conclusions that German forces had orchestrated the massacre. <NR456>

The commemoration of the pogrom on 10 July 1941 was far removed from the quiet ceremonies of years past, englulfing the town with proceedings both in the main square, and at the site of the Jewish cemetaries. The centerpiece of the event was the christening of a new memorial to the massacred jews, inscribed in Hebrew, Yiddish and Polishk, "In memory of the Jews of Jedwabne and surrounding areas, men women, and children, fellow dwellers of this land, murdered and burned alive at this site on 10 July 1941." In the Town Square, President Aleksander Kwasniewski and the Israli ambassador to Poland, Szewach Weiss, delivered speaches. Rabbi Jacob Baker, a former inhabitant of Jedwabne, and chief rabbi of Warsaw and Lodz, Michael Schudrich, lead prayers at the new memorial. In all, aproximately one thousand persons attended, including major political reppresentatives, families of Jewish victims, and, most of all, ordinary Poles from across Poland. 

Kwasniewski's speach was a milestone in the legacy of the jedwabne massacre, as far as official memory was concerned. He did not, however, share with Gross and other revisionists the ascription of guilt to the entire Polish nation. Neither did Kwasniewski reject it entirely:
    It is impermissible to speak of collective guilt, burdening the inhabitant of any town or nation with guilt. Every individual is accountable for only his or her actions. Sons do not inherit the guilt of their fathers. 
Guilt for the crime in Jedwabne, he reasoned, should be restricted to those who direlectly perpetrated the crime. This was not, however, an issue without national importance: "Are we permitted to say: that was long ago, these were other people? A nation is a commuity [...] of individuals, a comunity of generations." Kwasniewski's rejection of collective guilt echos that of Mayor Godlewski, who suggested an alternative: collective responsibility. Indeed, he continued, "we are here to perform a collective examination of conscience. We honor the victims and we say: never again." Poland's collective failure, he believed, was its society turing a blind eye to Poland's historical misteps:
    Today's Poland has the courage to look in the eye the truth about the nightmare that darkened one of the chapters of her history. We have come to realize that we are resonsible for our attitude toward the black pages of history. We have understood that those who counsel the nation to deny this past serve the nation ill.
Similarly, Kwasniewski made no offer of an apology on the behalf of the Polish nation, but neither did he make no offer of apology at all--he apologized on the behalf on himself and likeminded individuals: 
    I apologize in the name of those Poles whse conscience is moved by that crime.In name of those who believe that we cannot be proud of the magnificence of Polish history without at the same time feeling pain and shame for the wrongs that Poles have done to others.
Finally, he implored, "Today, let us all be inhabitans of Jedwabne. Let us feel as they do Let us remain with them in the feeling of grief, despair, shame and solidarity."

On that day, Jedwabne was, indeed, a model of "grief, despair, shame and solidarity." It was in the spirit of solidarity that both Jedwabne Mayor Godlewski and town council chairman Michalowski attended the ceremony. They did so, however, in oposition to the solidarity of Jedwabne and to the protests of the Town Council. Under the leadership of Father Orlowski, who described the event as a "Jewish Celebration", nearly all of Jedwabne's two-thousand residents boycotted the commemoration. Later, on 17 July 2001, in comments to a local newspaper Gazeta Wspolczesna, Orlowski condemned the ceremony as a "sheer lie."

The ceremony maked the climax of tensions in Jedwabne. On August 5, after a dispute between Mayor Godlewski and the town council regarding Godlewski's proposal to construct a road leading to the new memorial, Mayor Godlewski resigned as mayor. In solidarity, town council chairman Stanislaw Michalowski resigned, as well. Political gridlock between Godlewski and most of the town council was only partly the cause of his leave--Godlewski reported receiving threats:
    I’ve received letters… They called me a traitor, a fool, a Jewish lackey. It was painful. But the truth has its price. You need to bear the consequences of staying your beliefs. There were only few of those unpleasant letters, a minority. There were more serious threats, too. “You’ll end up with a bullet an your head”, said one. I feel that I’ve closed a chapter in my life. I’ve worked for 20 years in Jedwabne. I would like to begin a new life. A life away from politics. I’ve suffered enough emotionally.
Other prominent critics of Jedwabne shared similar experiences. Leon Dziedzic and his son Lesek were one of the few inhabitants of Jedwabne to provide non-anonymous critical commentary to the Polish media regarding the massacre. During the Pogrom, the Dziedzic family hid several Jews, saving their lives. Their comments to the Polish media made the family a popular target for apoligists; the family emmigrated from Jedwabne to the United States and applied for political asylum. Anatosia Wyrzykowska, who famously sheltered Szmul Wasersztein, also left Jedwabne and lived her remaining years in the United States under the care of the Kubran family, whom she had sheltered. Godlewski, too, eventually fled Jedwabne and found employment as a construction worker in the United States. 

The experience of Jedwabne in the storm of the controversy was a microcosm of broader Poland. Neighbors, unlike all previous treatments of the Jedwabne massacre, succeeded in penetrating broader public consciousness as deeply in Poland as it did in Jedwabne. Surveys conducted in April 2001 revealed that 90% of Poles were aware of the Jedwabne massacre--by August 2001, 97% of Poles had heard of the crime. Gross's thesis, however, had not been as convincing to the "vast majority of Poles" Kwasniewski had indicated. Only 11% of respondents believed Poles were primarily culpable for the crime, and only a slightly greater fraction, 19% believed that Poles shared the burdon guilt with the occupying Germans. Indeed, as notable as the roster of attendees of the 10 July commemoration was, it is less notable than the absences. While the ceremony was attended by members of the German episcopate, members of the Polish episcopate abstained from the event. 

Who the respondents believed the perpetrators were was strongly correllated with their educational and socio-vocational background. Those in cities were more than twice as likely to cite the participation of Poles as were those living in rural areas. Among respondents with a primary, vocational, high school, and higher education, the percentage of those who expressed a belief that Poles were, at least, partially culpable of the massacre correlated positively with education level; 15%, 18%, 25% and 29%, respectively. Similar patterns were observed across socio-vocational groups: 27% of repondents employed as directorial staff or as part of the inteligencja indicated they believed that poles were partially culpable; only 11 and 13% of skilled workers and farmers responded similarly. Moreover, those who worked as laborers or had only a primary or vocational education were were markedly more rigid in their beliefs. A follow-up survey conducted in August 2001 revealed that the number of respondents with a higher education who believed that only Germans were culpable decreased from 35% to 19%, and the percent of those who believed that Poles were somewhat culpable increased from 29% to 52%. Conversely, those with only a primary education actually became slightly less likely to believe Poles were culpable, and slightly likelier to believe that only Germans were involved. The number directorial staff and inteligencja who believed that only Germans were culpable decreased from 43% to 14%, and the percent who beleived that Poles were partially culpable increased 25% to 57%. 

Overwhelmingly, respondents in April--before the official expiation act of July 10--opposed any official act of expiation (48% in opposition, 30% in favor). And, when official ceremonies were held on July 10, 38% of respondents reported that they had followed media coverage event. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, similar educational and socio-vocational traits patterned respondents: Of those who followed the event, a majority had a higher education (54%) or were representatives of directorial staff and inteligencja (46%). This demographic was also the most optimistic that the controversy over the Jedwabne massacre would ultimately strengthen Polish-Jewish relations. Kwasniewski's statements at the commemoration may have been representative of the views of himself and the event's attendees, but his extension of those beliefs onto the nation of Poland was either a miscalculation or a misrepresentation.

The woes of broader Poland in relation to the Jedwabne controversy mostly mirrored those of Jedwabne's inhabitants. In the absence of the official report, doubts of the historicity of Gross's account provided a vehical for deferring the moral ramifications. Mirroring Godlewski's lament that the exact number of Jews was unknown, a fixation emerged regarding the precise number of victims. In an online dicussion on 17 May 2001, Gross faced questioning from skeptics who wondered how it was possible for 1,600 people to perish at once in a small barn. Gross responded, "It wasn't such a small barn at all. Besides, you can pack in as many people you want with the use of scythes, pitchforks, and knives." The barn, to Gross's credit, was relatively large--nineteen by seven meters. Such debates extended into the traditional bounds of academia. "Every historian," insisted Bogdan Musial, a prominent Polish historian of the holocaust, "should be aware of how problematic--and at the same time how important--an accurate and honest estimate of the number of victims is. Although '1,600' had long been the most widely accepted count of victims, estimates made before Neighbors ranged wildly, from as little as 300 to as many as 3,000. In The Massacre in Jedwabne, Polish historian Marek Chodakiewicz disputed both the severity of the massacre and the identity of its perpetrators. In contrast to Gross's estimate of 1,600 casualties, Chodakiewicz suggested a more paltry six hundred deaths. Musial argued for a far lower number:
    According to Soviet data, in September 1940 in the entire Jedwabne region, there were 37,000 ethnic Poles, 185 Belarusians, and 1,400 Jews. [...] In yet other Soviet documents, we find the information that in 1940, Jedwabne counted 562 Jews, while Wizna counted 476 and Radzilow about 500. The sum total thencomes to about 1,540 Jews in the whole raion. These figures, as well as the lack of any serious discrepancies between them, allow us to conclude that around 600 jews lived in the town of Jedwabne. <NR325>
The partial exhumation of the grave carried out by the IPN, Bogdal continues, produced estimates of 300-400 victims. This discrepency with Gross's numbers, Musial implies, wass indicitive of, at best, sloppy historiography and, at worse, motivaded fabrication. "For reasons not explained in his book, Gross accepted the figure of 1,600. [...] In spite of the publications criticizing his conclusions in Neighbors, and contrary to the findings during the partial exhumation, Gross still insists that local Poles murdered 1,600 of their Jewish 'neighbors' in Jedwabne on 10 July 1941" <NR324-326>

Gross disputed Musial's challenge with equal vehemence, understanding that Musial's claims implied that Gross's ability as a historian was in doubt. Gross contended that he did not conjour "1,600" without reason:
    Irrespective of what my polemicists would like the readers to believe, the number of "1,600" victims is not by invention. This is a number, or rather the order of magnitude, that describes how many Jews were killed in Jedwabne on 10 July 1941. Specifically, "1,600" was given as the number of victims in Waserztajn's testimony; this very number was carved by the polish authorities two decades ago into the stone monument at the site of the barn; "one and a half thousand" is offered as the tally of victims by Polish witnesses at the trial, and the same number appears in a secret police summary report; "1,460" is given in the memorial book of the Jedwabne Jews; and "1,640" appears currently on the Jedwabne high school Website.
Similarly, Gross and his supporters disputed the reputability of the exhumation. The most important facet of this debate, however, was that Gross and his supporters disputed the importance of the victim count at all. "These are all, if you will, identicial figures insofar as they convey the truth accepted by all--namely, that by and large the entire Jedwabne Jewish community was murdered on that single day." Gross's response was not above polemics: "There is a remarkable irony in the broad-mindedness of assorted right-wing nationalist writers who wouldn't normally touch a communist with a ten foot pole, and who are suddenly embracing as incontrovertible truth some "soviet data" just to prove me wrong."



 And 1600 is, more or less, how many Jews should have been there, judging by the 1921 and 1931 population sensuses. 
    
Gross:
Besides, the moral issues at state, as well as implications for Poles' self-understanding as to the historical significance of their collective experience during the German occupation, remain exactly the same, no matter whehter 400 or 1,600 Jews were killed on 10 July.



There is a remarkable irony in the broad-mindedness of assorted right-wing nationalist writers who wouldn't normally touch a communist with a ten foot pole, and who are suddenly embracing as incontrovertible truth some "soviet data" just to prove me wrong."




In his critical review of Neighbors, Musial argued that 

Bogdan Musial, a prominant historian of the holocaust, proposed in his critical review of Neighors a far reduced number of victims. "Every historian," insisted Bogdan Musial, "should be aware of how problematic--and at the same time how important--an accurate and honest estimate of the number of victims is.


Estimates made before Neighbors ranged wildly, from as little as 300 to as many as 3,000. 

"other soviet documents we find the information 

Mayor Godlewski, whose role in the roundtable that of a mediator, lamanted "We could accept the truth if only we knew it in full. For instance, if the exact number of Jews were established." 

A fixation on establishing the precise number of victims emerged.

Unbelievably,

Jedwabne faced a pressing set of questions 

How should Jedwabne Memorialize the Jews? 
    -naming the school
    -the monument?

Perhaps it shouldn't - Orlowski
    - Challenged the historicity of the massacre
    - 

That Jedwabne had changed, however, was one of the only points of agreement. 



Jedwabne became polarized between apologists and revisionists. 


"Father Orlowski has his information, and we have hours. How are we to tell who is right?"

"Over 95 percent of Jedwabne's preasent population came hear after the war. These people have no connection with the events of the summer of 1941."

I am thinking back to a recent visit to Jedwabne to gather material for a television report. The town was living in fear. An invasion by journalists from all over the world was underway, and Jedwabne was consolidating a defense of its honor.

<NR63-Szczensa> "The truth is sacred. It's obvious that the inscrition must be changed." says the mayor. "However, I'm not in favor of simply naming the perpetrators of the crime. The assasins from Jedwabne were a handful."

<NR65-kaczynska> "we've been coming here for hree years now and we light small cnaldes" says an eldly woman from Jedwabne who was eight years old on 10 July 1941. 

Jedwabne mayor Krzystof Godlewski and the town and district chairman Stanislaw Michalowski came ot the monument yestrrday before noon. They bought a mourining weath with a ribbon decorated with the words "For the murdered jedwabne residents of Jewish nationality, in memory and admonition--society"

Presence of residents, journalists, and a crew from olish national television. 

Godlewski -- "an investigation should be conducted and the truth should be established, one to which we will adhere. We cannot allowthe new monument to divide peole. This monument should unify and not divide. It should be a warning for the future.

Michalowski: "We've been stuck with the reputation of a criminal town. This is unfair. As in every community, different kinds of people lived here. We must differentiate the criminals from the nomral people. This was just as much a tragedy for the latter as for those murdered.
