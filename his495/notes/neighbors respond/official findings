IPN report

The IPN report mostly corroborated Gross's findings. On that morning, inhabitants of nearby villages began to stream into Jedwabne. It is likely that at least some of Jedwabne's jewish residents were warned, as examples can be found of Jedwabne's Jews leaving the town before the massacre. Later that morning, the Jews that remained were ordered out of their homes, and directed to pluck grass from between the cobblestones in the town square. The IPN found that witness statements recalling acts of violence against the Jews at this state were likely correct. During this stage of the event, some number of Jews were murdered individually. Numerous witnesses, which the IPN deemed reliable, reported the arrival of a small group of uniformed germans. This group assisted in driving the victims to the square, but their sure role is limited to this. Around noontime, a group of Jewish men complied to an order to fell the square's Lenin monument and subseuqnetly carried the bust to the barn on a wooden stretcher. An hour later, no less than three hundred people were led into Bronislaw Sleszynski's kerosene-doused barn. The IPN was unable to determine whether Germans played any role in escorting victims to the barn, or whether they were present at the time the barn was set alight. 

The IPN report, however, deviates from Gross's narrative in several areas. The hypothesis that the massacre was documented by German photographers could not be sufficiently substantiated by witnesses and photographic evidence has yet to be found. The IPN, on the basis of its partial exhumation, concluded that the long-stated figure of 1,600 jews was highly unlikely. Criminal law, the framework which the IPN was mandated to form its conclusions within, was insufficient in ascribing moral culpability: "the utter passivity of part of Jedwabne's population in relation to the crime committed on 10 july 1941 cannot be qualified in terms of criminal law, and therefore cannot be evaluated in terms of ascribing responsibility. <NR135>

ypothesis that germans took photos not sufficiently substantiated 

he IPN concluded that some number of murders occured before the Jews were led from 

Thursday morning, inhabitants of nearby villiages began to arrive in Jedwabne
Some jewish residents were warned

10 July 1941, Jewish population forced uot of their homes. Ordered to pluck grass from between comblestoons. Acts of violence in occured.

Numerous witnesses corroborate the arrival of uniformed germans. Small group, assisted in driving the victims to the market place, role limited to this <NR133>

Unclear whether Germans excorted the victims to the place of murder, and wheter they were present at the barn.

Group of jewish men were forced to fell a Lenin monument.
At noon, that goup forced to carry bust to barn on wooden stretcher. 40-50 people. Not clear how they were killed, but bodies were thrown into the grave dug inside the barn.

After an hour, about 300 people were led into wooden barn owned by Bronislaw Sleszynski. Doused with kerosene.

Individual murders carried out before people were led from the market.

NUMBER OF VICTIMS
1,600 seems highly unlikely
Some jewish people survived; several dozen lived inthe town until 1942

Hypothesis that germans took photos not sufficiently substantiated <NR144>

INSPIRATION
Yes, inspired by the germans.
DId not actively participate, but this is, legally speaking, complacency. <NR135>

No less than fourty Poles, inhabitants of Jedwabne and environs perpetrator for the crime.

"the utter passivity of part of Jedwabne's population in relation to the crime committed on 10 july 1941 cannot be qualified in terms of criminal law, and therefore cannot be evaluated in terms of ascribing responsibility. <NR135>

Jedwabne--Let us Be Silent in the Face of this Crime: Piotr Lipinski Talks with Professor Andrzej Rzeplinski

PL: those who were convicted in the trial later claimed that they had been beaten. Were theri confessions forced.?

AR:
Examined by eight UB officials in Lomza
Very young, 21-31
Lacked requesite qualifications,"What they knew about how to beat people up. Ten of the accused complained during the trial that they had been beaten."

"They didn't do this to extort detailed confessions. The goal of these secret police functionaries was to limit the matter as severly as possible. For instance, when a witness said that in the murder of Jews the following persons took part..., the official would write down only one name. When other names were mentioned, he changed the subject. " <NR138>


Interrogation commensed with an indication of the specific accusation against him.

Judge should have returned investigation to office <138>

PL: Trial began on 16 May 1949 before the District Court in Lomza. Within two days a verdict was returned. How could a verdict in such a major crime be given in such a short time?

AR: "To be frank, I cannot imagine" <NR139>
court examinedi nthe course of 16 hours 22 accused and 56 witnesses: 78 people
Just six minutes per person.

"Judge had a conscious policy of allowing the witness to say as little as possible. This was agreed to by the prosecutors, while the defense took the view that this would be of interest to their clients."

What was decided? <140>
- Prosecutor hit upon date of 25 June
- but barn was burned on July 10. <25 June day of first linching and killings>

No topographical narrative.
No exumation; "In this trial, quite simply, there were no victims."

PL: Why was so little decided?
"The chairman of the judges, Antoni Malecki, came from a peasent family in the area and certainly shared the resentments of local people" <141>

PL: Was Jedwabne a political trial? <142>
It was political in the sense that an attemp was amade to diminish the significance of the whole matter--some people killed some others, but in the end it isnot clear who killed whom and why. 

"A large trial would have had no Political benefits."
While there was no way to show that Germans killed Jews, to accuse a large group of poles would have resulted in an international scandal.

PL: Was a cdecision taken at a higher level?
No

PL: How many Jews did the court believe died? <143>
Totally unclear; 1,200 and 1,500. No names meantioned. k
