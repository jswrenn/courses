Holc - Working through Jan Gross's "Neighbors"
http://www.jstor.org/stable/3090294
<543>
Topic of Neighbors is violent transformation of multiethnic community into ethnically + religiously homogenous one
Neighbors has created enormous debate and controversy in Poland
has contributed to an ongoing revaluaton of National Identity
Gross aimed to "correct a cultural reluctance"
incorporates his own sense of moral outrange, invites reader to share in the shock

What Gross Says:
	Massacure occured in a single day, 10 July 1941
	Germany army was only begining to institutionalize control of eastern poland
	With withdrawal of soviet forces came realization that new occupiers would not punish violence against jews
	Also, a culture of antisemitism
	Preceeded by several individual acts of violence
	Ambiguous order from gestapo
	Began when mayor jsummoned all jewish residents to the town square
	1,600 jews killed in a barn
	left over property seized
	catholic family who hid jews driven out of town
	Sources
		Survivor testimony <- lends account emotional power <455>
			Atypical - survivor accounts traditionally seen as problematic
		Documents from 1953 trial
	Does not normalize ethnic conflict <- notable, holc claims.

His text does not find all non-jewish Poles collectively anti-Semitic or murderous
does not compare Jedwabne experience with other anti-jewish pogroms, but does mention them
[How does normalization change things?]

<456> How historically determined was the loss of Jewish Presence?
	Gross defines collective identity as cannon, assembled from deeds that are special and striking.
	If non-jewish pole claims chopin as part of collective inheritance, must also acknowledge acts of violence and brutality

Gross refuses to contain concept of the holocaust within boundaries of German and Nazi behavior
	Or to limit it geographically to ghettos. Jews experience violence in places they had been for generations

No other groups besides the jews faced systematic extermination
specificity of jewish vulnerability obscured postware
assertions of importance of jewish experience posed as threats to validity of catholic polish experience of victimization during German and soviet campaigns

Construction of two separate victomhood experiences "situated as competative and mutually exclusive"
	Pro:Polish, or pro-Jewish argument
	"colaborator or resister"
	"accept coollective responsibility or contribute to anti-semitism"
	[He doesn't go far enough: polish or non-polish!]

Neighbors opens up a challenge to recognize power of etnic categories without resorting to ethnic-determinism

<458>
? Is this discursive hegemony commensurate with a casual explanation for the murder by Catholic Poles of a group of Jewish Poles, or for the absense of intervention?
	Unanswered in neighbors
Holk says reader is frustrated by fluctation between emphasis of ethnic determinism vs individual decision
Holc argues flucation is productive in that it prevents a definite choide between them
Such a choise would forestall the more productive process of "working through" a historical event rather than simply representing it.
Neighbors doesn't deliver a victory either way. 

Tone of moral outrage unfortunately leads gross to some oversimplifications

<459>
Before Neighbors, knowledge of Jedwabne was part of a passive history vs a transformative knowing

http://www.jstor.org/stable/3090295

Part 1: Credibility of Neighbors
Gross's theses are often groundless because of one-sided selection of sources and a priori interpretation
gross's evidence should be presented in light of what we now know
	Chdakiewicz has extensively documented current state of knowledge on jedwabne massacre
	See: His review of neighbors in Dzieje Najnowsze by Bogdan Musial
		Gross accepts sources at face value
		Takes for granted testimonies of Abram Boruszczak and Eliasz Gradowski, former had never been to jedwabne; latter was absent during massacre
		Mixes up testimonies of the Laudanskies
		Failed to check credebility of the testimonies even when the witness change their mind
		Failed to distinguish eyewitness acount from second-hand desposition
	1941 mayor of Jedwabne was not elected but appointed by the nazis
	Disputes figure of 1,600 victims
	See: Alexander B. Rossino
		Inconstancy
		Gross contends no germans were in jedwabne on the massacre
		Relies on the testimonies who SAW Hermann Schaper
Flawed Methedology
	Did not crosscheck material evidence
	Does not contextualize Jedwabne
	Nothing said about brutalization under the soviets
	Revenge and counter revenge
	Scale of common banditry
	Reader eroneously left with impression that anti-semitism was only reason for the murders <461>

Neighbors is not a scholarly monograph but a political pamphlet
	The prose of the scholar but not the subtance
Intentions hard to guess
	"For poland this is a chance to face credibility and to face sins of the past" - Gross in NYT
	One may wonder if poland really has no credibility
	Bizzare to claim that credibility is gained by presenting a biased image
	If it had been balanced, ambiguity of morality might have been present
	Instead HIS EFFORTS WERE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
	"Provocation is not always the best way to induce moral reflection"

Part II What happened and what it means

Presented by gross derived from facts but taken on a new life

Claim: "One half killed the other half"
	Between 200 and 400 victims
	100 active perpetrators, mistly poles
	Gross quotes naims of only 92 people who took part in the pogrom

In early polish version of neighbors, "one half killing the other half" does not appear
	Introduced in english version
	"In poland it would not sell at all"

Gross ignores presence of Germance
	Now, we know that some were and they played a leading role

"Western pundits more frequently followed his example and [...] issued emotion  statements and conclusions corresponding to their sterotypical perception of the Poles and the Jews"

Rightist Politicians denied any polish participation in anti-jewish crimes. treated accusations as anti-polish

Gross's book unacceptable to historians
	Thomasz Strzembosz noted gros's selectivity in choosing witnesses
	Thomasz Szarota points out insufficient research
	Pawel Machceqicz and Krzysztof Jasiewicz discussies serious gaps in documentation and logic
	Marek CHodakiewicz reconstructed existing evidence
><463>
"Are facts important?"
"Legitimate to question scale of polish participation in Jedwabne massacre, but it is impossible to deny it"
Until recently, polish history has been written from position of the victims

"It really does matter whether one ohalf killed the other
Implies poles suffered guilt by association

Part III: Guilty or Innocent Nations

Major discussions on both sides reject collective responsibility, but apply it ot the opposing side
Absurd: no innocent or guilty nations

Jewish side treats this as "Operation Whitewash"
Jewish collaboration in holocaust as counterpoint to collective guilt

Two sides:
	Murders were not Poles but Bandits
	gross argues that victims were not Communists, but Jews
	Denies jewish participation in communism
	[This doesn't seem to refute racial violence...]
