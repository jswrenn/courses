------------------------------------------------------------------------

In his detailed 2011 synopsis of the investigation and trial, "Jedwabne Before the Court," Krzysztof Persak described a set of pervasive tropes in the accounts given. Initial testimonies by those detained were forthcoming in admitting non-violent participation. He notes Władysław Dąbrowski’s testimony as charactaristic of this pattern: "I did not take part in murdering Jews; I only took part in guarding them in the market square." The details of the actual murder were less forthcoming; the suspects spoke reluctantly about the events near the barn, and only four admitted to being there. Conversely, most of the individuals sought as prosecuting witnesses claimed emphetically to know nothing about any murder of Jews. The latter trope came to charactarize the processions of hearing before the Lomza District court on May 16 and 17, 1949. Most of the defendents redacted the statements they made during the investigation, and all pled not guilty. Although the defense attempted to shift the blame away from the accused, Persat notes that none proposed a narrative that shifted full responsibility for the massacre onto Gestapo forces. Ultimately, the court concluded that, while complicity in murder was a severe crime, those involved had been "forced to cooperate" with the Gestapo. Eleven of the defendents were sentenced to between eight and ten years of prison. Only one, Karol Bardoń, the was sentenced to death on the basis that he acted voluntarily. The remaining ten defendents were aquited for lack of evidence.

The prosecutors did not attempt to produce a complete narrative of the events of the pogrom, but the statements of the judges nonetheless suggest a crude outline. "The violence employed by the Germans [with respect] to the defendants was a result of a great number in which they appeared in Jedwabne on the critical day, and [of] the fact that the Jews had to be driven out of their homes to the assembly point, which the Germans could not do due to their relatively small number." While there were not a significant enough number of Germans to carry out the pogrom themselves, their numbers were such that they were able to coerce some of Jedwabne's inhabitants into cooperation. Moreover, they went on to clarify coercian should not be understood in the limited sense of a German personally overseeing that each defendant carried out their orders. <422>

Nonwithstanding a minor retrial that occured in 1954, historical memory of the Jedwabne massacre remained mostly static for another decade. In either 1962 or 1963, a monument memorializing the victims of the pogrom was erected by the Lozma ZBoWiD on the site of the mass grave in Jedwabne <NR52>. It's inscription purported both a count of the pogrom's victims and the identities of the perpentrators. "Execution site of the Jewish Population. The Gestapo and Nazi gendarmarie burned alive 1,600 people on 10 July, 1941". <424> In 1967, the Main Commission to Investigate Nazi War Crimes in Poland launched investigations into war crimes in the Bialystok region. The investigation into the Jedwabne crime similarly described it as "burning of around 1,600 Jews from Jedwabne, Łomża district, by the Germans in July 1941."

In 1966, Syzmon Datner, in an article in the Bulletin of the Jewish Historical Institute characterized the anti-Jewish crimes in the Bialystok after the attack on the USSR by Germany as being the product of German special operations forces. According to Datner, German units organized "outbursts", for propagandistic purposes: "As a rule, they photographed the scenes that were played out as evidence that the Jews were hated not only by the Germans." He contends that Germans collaborated with Poles in these crimes, supplying arms and inciting racial tension, but shying away from direct participation when possible. "The germans draged the dregs of the local community, as well as the so called Blue Police into these chrimes. This was a phenomenon that was relatively rare in occupied Poland, as well as in the rest of the Bialystok region, where the location population--Polish and Belarusian alike--refused to be hoodwinked by German provcation [...] In a few cases , the local scum and criminal elements allowed themselves to be used as henchmen by the Germans. However, the majority of the work was done by German Hands."
    
While Datner did not specifically describe the pogroms of Jedwabne, the model he described remained the primary premise of descriptions of the Jedwabne pogrom until the publication of Neighbors. After a three-year freeze of the renewed investigations begining in 1968, the legal investigation of the Jedwabne crime was taken over in 1971 by Waldemar Monkiewic. Over the next three years, Monkiewic interrogated five witnesses, resulting in the identificatio nof several Germans involved in the Pogrom. One witness, Julia Sokołowska, a cook at the gendarmarie post in Jedwabne, claimed there was a confluence of 240 gendarmaries in Jedwabne--most from surounding towns. Follow-up investigations conducted by Germany failed to bear fruit, and the Polish investigation into Jedwabne was discontined in 1977.

Between 1982 and 1989, Monkiewic published a series of articles purporting to construct a historical timeline of the events in Jedwabne. According to blankity blankerson, these reports reflected the best summary of historical memory after the pogrom. In 1986, in a ceremony marking the 250th aniversary of Jedwabne's town charter, Monkiewicz stated the pogrom was initiated when 150 police entered Jedwabne by motor vehical, and estimated between six-hundred and nine-hundred Jewish casualities. For what he described as "understandable reasons", he omitted mention of the names of the Polish auxiliary police known to be involved in the crime. Monkiewicz, gave a detailed synopsis of the event in Jedwabne three years later in the University of Bialystok's Studio Podlaskie:
    "In early July 1941, 200 men from the 309th and 316th german police battalions were detached to form a special unit, called Kommando Bialystok, under the command of Wolfgang Birkner, who was seconded from the Warsaw Gestapo. Only 10 july, this unit arrived in Jedabne by truck. Bot the gendarmerie and the auxiliary police were engaged in the operation carried out against the Jews. The auxiliary police were involved only in leading the victims to the square and escorting the victims to the square and escorting them out of the town. There, the Nazis commited unspeakable cruelty, driving some 900 people into a barn that they next closed, and the walls of which they splashed with gasoline and set alight, causing the martyrs deaths of the men, women, and children inside."

Jan T. Gross's first published revisionist analysis of the Jedwabne events--an essay published in 1999, "Lato 1941 w Jedwabnem" in the multi-author book, Non-provincial--went largly unnoticed. The work featured Wasersztejn's eye-witness account of the pogrom, but lacked the direction and force of his followup work. It was not until he saw Agnieszka Arnold's documentary "Neighbors" that he came to the "realization that Wasersztejn had to be taken literally." <NR341> In the Spring of 2000, Gross published "Sasiedzi: Historia zaglady zydowskiego miasteczka" (followed by it's english edition "Neighbors" a year later). At the same time, Gross, a professor of history at Princeton, published a series of english-language lectures on Jedwabne that were circulated on the internet.

As a revisionist work, Neighbors bears the onus on demonstrating the necessities of its revisions. As such, Neighbors detailed not just the events of the progrom, but contextualizes it the history and future of Jedwabne. Gross begins thusly, with a brief history of Poland and the town of Jedwabne. When Jedwabne received its town charter in 1736, it had alredy been settled for at least three hundred years. It's Jewish population bled over from the nearby town of Tykocin, and Jews were initially subject to the Tykocin Jewish communal authority. By 1770, however, Jedwabne Jews constructed a wooden synnagogue. The Jewish population numbered three-hundred-eighty-seven, a clear majority in a town with a total population of only four-hundred-fifty. Jedwabne's population climaxed at 3,000 on the eve of WWI but the devastation of war and the russian policy of jewish resettlement from near-front-line territories reduced the number of inhabitants to seven hundred. Over the next two decades, Jedwabne's population slowly recovered. By 1931, Jedwabne boasted 2,167 inhabitants. Jews formed a majority of the town's 144 craftsmen. The interwar period, was not without sporadic bouts of antisemitism. In 1934, a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne. The shooting of a peasent in a neighboring town a few days later fueled a rumor that Jedwabne's Jews had taken revenge on the poles. However, Gross contends that, true to his monograph's title, Jedwabne's Jews and Poles were mostly peaceful neighbors.

The first period of Soviet occupation strained this uneasy relationship. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact on August 23, 1939 paved the way for WWII and effectively partitioned Poland between the USSR and Germany. Hitler's armies invaded poland on September 1, 1939, followed by the Red Army on September 17. The precise boundaries of the parition, however, were not finalized until September 28th. Thus, for a brief period in the Autumn of 1939, Jedwabne was occupied by the Wehrmact, then surrendered to Soviet authorities. During this period, Jews across Poland aquired the reputaiton of having a priveledged relationship with the soviet occupiers. Gross does not doubt that Jews filled some government positions, but contends that there are no indications that the relationship between Jews and Poles in Jedwabne was any more antagonistic than elsewhere in Poland.

In Gross's account in Neighbors, pogrom began on the morning of July 10, 1941, when Jedwabne's town council met with the Gestapo. Shortly thereafter, the town's mayor ordered Jedwabne's gendarmerie to organize the non-Jewish population of the town for the collection of nearby Jews into the town square. After being gathered into the town square, one group of Jews was ordered to dismantle a statue of Vladamir Lenin and carry it out of town while singing Soviet anthems. This group of Jews, including the local Rabbi, were lead into a barn and killed. Later that day, the remaining Jewish population of Jedwabne was gathered into the barn and immolated.
